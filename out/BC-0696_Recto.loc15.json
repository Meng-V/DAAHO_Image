    "transcript": "October 20, 1937\n\nPresident William M. Jardine\nUniversity of Wichita\nWichita, Kansas\n\nMy dear Jardine:\n\nYou may recall that when I was in your home last June I indicated with very little confidence that the Uphams were hoping to utilize a sabbatical leave for winter vacation this year for a trip around the world. One obstacle after another seems to arise to prevent this, but we are still pushing ahead with our plans and have engaged passage on a boat leaving San Francisco November 13. Of course we shall have to detour around China, and perhaps a few other places, but we are due to reach Cairo about February 14 and make that our headquarters until the end of February. We have no detailed plans for those two weeks but expect to make the trip to Luxor and also to Jerusalem.\n\nI am wondering if in the light of your experience and acquaintance there you would have any suggestions you would care to offer or would indicate any people whom we ought to see. I am told that this is the busiest time of the year there, and well understand how that would be so. If only you and your family were located there once more, this part of our trip would be a real holiday. As it is, we shall be just some other American tourists.\n\nI am not letting much publicity out in regard to this winter trip, because however valuable it may be for professors to enjoy sabbatical travel, the public hardly approves of presidents doing such wasteful things.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nPresident",
