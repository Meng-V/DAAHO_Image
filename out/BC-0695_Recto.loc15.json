C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPrasob Sukhvasth, who has returned to Miami University this fall to continue his college course here, has asked me to write you regarding the record and impression he has made on our campus.\n\nDuring his earlier residence with us we all came to think very highly of him, both on account of his natural ability and because of the determination with which he went to work to improve upon his record in the east and to profit by the educational opportunities here. Except for his wider experience he was just another Miami student, unassuming, dependable, and interested in what life here had to offer. He did first class work in his studies and made many friends among students and faculty. We have all been delighted to have him return to us this year.\n\nThere is every indication that the young man has entered upon his work this fall with the same fine spirit he manifested before. In the interval he has had added experience in teaching and in newspaper work, so that he has more definite objectives than before. His idea of continuing here until he has completed work for the master's degree seems to me entirely sound, since he will have slightly more than enough credits for the A. B. degree at Commencement time in June, and can qualify for the master's degree by the middle of the next college year, about February 1, 1939. I am sure that you may count upon him to do what he undertakes and fulfill all obligations.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nPresident",
