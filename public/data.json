His idea of continuing here until he has completed work for the master's degree seems to me entirely sound, since he will have slightly more than enough credits for the A.

We shall have to be detoured around China, but we still have every assurance that your country will be open to visitors and that we shall have every opportunity to get around.

We have reservations at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo for several days. We are to reach Kioto Wednesday afternoon, December 1, and will be at the Miyako Hotel there. We plan to sail from Kobe Sunday, December 5. I am writing you these details so that it may be easier for you to establish contact with us, and not with the thought that you should feel any obligation whatever to show us around or do things for us. We have arranged a rather busy itinerary with the American Express, and hope that the rather unusual conditions now prevailing will not interfere too seriously with what we should like to do.  \n\nWith all good wishes,  \n\nVery truly yours,  \n\nPresident",

If he will arrange to undertake this responsibility, I shall hope of course that you may find it convenient to escort him out here and enjoy with him the Commencement atmosphere that always characterizes Miami University.\n\nI had hoped for an occasion which would take me to Washington before this time.
